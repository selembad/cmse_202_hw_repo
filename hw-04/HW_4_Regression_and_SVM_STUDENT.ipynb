Imagine we create a sophisticated model that accurately predicts rain/no rain ~60% of the time; without any other information, we might think, \"That's not too bad, I guess.\" It certainly feels better than *no* information, right? Now think about the base rate frequency model, which achieves an accuracy of **70%** just by guessing the same thing every time. Suddenly, our sophisticated model seems like crap!
